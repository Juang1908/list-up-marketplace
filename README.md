# Listup Marketplace

## Description

We built this app to provide a place for users to shop for second hand items in niche categories. Here you can find vintage clothing, modded vehicles, upcycled furniture, and/or retro gaming systems. Users must create an account and log in to see the inventory available. In a normal marketplace setting a user would have to search through thousands of listings to find a few good items that would fall into these categories. With this app that would not be an issue since we are bringing the right items to them. In building this we were able to refine our knowledge of bulma, routes and displaying images with handlebars. We hope that users will find the site to be user friendly and make buying from a second hand marketplace a bit more efficient.
